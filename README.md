# GravityReal

## Note: Java 17 and Minecraft 18 or higher are now required

This is my First JavaPlugin, so please don't kill me if some syntax still isn't perfect.

## How to use

1. Place GravityReal into your plugins folder
2. Restart your Server (a folder will be created)
3. Edit the config.yml how you want and setup new maps

## Upgrading

!! Read the release notes carefully, but you may have to delete the old config.yml to use a new one.

## Permissions

If your permissions plugin strips permissions then you may have to allocate these manually.

```
permissions:    
  gravityreal.admin:
    description: Allows you to set-up maps, adding spawnpoints and setting difficulty.
    default: false
  gravityreal.spawn:
    description: Teleports you to the lobby spawpoint
    default: false
  gravityreal.coords:
    description: Shows you your current coordinates
    default: false
  gravityreal.gamemode.creative:
    description: Sets the CREATIVE gamemode
    default: false
```
